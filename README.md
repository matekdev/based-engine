# Based Engine

Based on what? Based Engine is a 3D DirectX 11 "engine" written in modern C++. The goal is to create a 3D playground that allows me to easily interact and implement various graphics features.

The previous iteration of this project used [OpenGL](https://github.com/matekdev/based-engine-opengl). After implementing shadow maps I felt comfortable enough to swap to DirectX11 and reimplement the previous features but also continue with various others.
