# Based Engine

Based on what? Based Engine is a 3D DirectX 11 "engine" written in modern C++. The goal is to create a 3D playground that allows me to easily interact and implement various graphics features.

The previous iteration of this project used [OpenGL](https://github.com/matekdev/based-engine-opengl). After implementing shadow maps, I felt confident enough to switch to DirectX 11. I plan to reimplement the previous features done in OpenGL and continue adding new ones as well. At some point I plan to transition over to DirectX 12 using [D3D11On12](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/direct3d-11-on-12) but that is extremely down the line.
